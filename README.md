# Loan-Prediction-Using-Classification
In this project, we will create the models using train dataset we have to predict the loan approval in test dataset. I have used Classification algorithms to get the best accuracy score among them.
I have used Logisitic Regression first, followed by K fold stratified Logistic regresiion to improve the accuracy score. Also created the models using Decision Tree,Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms and found out the best accuracy scores from created 4 models.
